Lightning Talk on Functional Programming in Python and Parallel Programming in Python.
<!--more-->

<b>Functional Programming in python :-</b>

Python is best known to be an OOP language, but due to its multi-paradigm nature, it makes functional programming easy to perform, and easy to mix with other programming styles.

We can enhance our code by using the 76 builtin functions or write our own functions.For user-defined Python offers a lot of variants, from ordinary functions to decorators, generators to coroutines.

In this session, we will take you through the journey of writing from builtin functions to user-defined functions to decortors.

<b>Speaker:  Udhay Prakash Pethakamsetty, Sr. Engineer, Infor Global Solutions</b>

-------------------------------------------------------
