Title: About Us

## Welcome!

Hyderabad Python User group is growing and active Python user community in Hyderabad. We believe in "Knowledge is power, community is strength"!!!

Meet other local Python developers, learners, employers, and enthusiasts of all kinds.
 All skill levels are welcome: if you are interested in Python, we are interested in you!

## We have great regular events:

** Monthly presentation series : ** these are longish presentations (about an hour) about topics of interest to the community.
 Often we also have lightning talks (5-15 minutes) also.
 If you have something you'd like to share with everyone, drop a line to the organizers!

** Monthly informal project nights: ** these are a chance to sit down with other Python developers of all
experience levels to push your project forward, get help with a particular trouble spot,
share expertise, or do whatever else you like.
